# Samixx-Mini-Blog

Hello, to everyone reading this i hope you're having a good day
This is a MERN STACK (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) PROJECT, i recently started learning react and i hadn't really done anything useful with it, so i decided to work on a mini anime blog.
The idea behind the blog is for users to anonymously post articles with different names.
I made use of express to make API routes and cors to allow cross origin sharing. I also use Mongoose to communicate with my MongoDb server.
After the stress of working on the backend, i use react to dynamically render the blog from the backend, i mad use of the Axios library to make GET and POST requests to my backend, and i used useEffect to render the content on mount. I also added loading states and error states in case a request goes wrong.

Over all this project is far from perfect and there's definately room improvement for  but.... i gained new insight on things, thanks for your time

Hello, everyone! I hope you're having a fantastic day. Today, I want to share with you a project I've been working on â€“ a mini anime blog built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

I recently embarked on a journey to learn React, and I wanted to put my newfound knowledge to good use. That's when I came up with the idea of creating this anime blog. The concept behind it is simple: users can post articles anonymously, each attributed to a different pseudonym.

For the backend of this project, I leveraged Express.js to set up API routes and utilized CORS to enable cross-origin sharing. To interact with my MongoDB server, I turned to Mongoose, a fantastic library for managing MongoDB connections.

Now, the real fun begins with React. I used React to dynamically render the blog content retrieved from the backend. To achieve this, I harnessed the power of Axios, a promise-based HTTP client, to make GET and POST requests to my backend. To ensure smooth rendering, I employed the useEffect hook to fetch and display the content when the component mounts. I also implemented loading and error states to handle any potential hiccups in the request process.

While I must admit that this project is far from perfect and there's always room for improvement, the journey has been incredibly rewarding. I've gained valuable insights and hands-on experience in web development, particularly in working with React and setting up a backend with Express.js and MongoDB.

Thank you for taking the time to read about my mini anime blog project.
